# SmartCarProject
UNSW ENGG1000 Smart Car project that autonomously navigate through a defined track whilst following traffic rules and conditions.

__Our project mission statement is:
_There is a need to design and build a small scale autonomous car that can navigate appropriately in various
traffic conditions such as red or green lights, variable speed limits and lane constraints including curvature in
roads. The car must be independent of human interaction upon activation, have a maximum height of 40cm
and width of 50cm, and drive on a standard grade MDF board. It must cost less than $120.__
